**A LFG website for College Students. Made in React.**

Uses React as the frontend and SQL as the backend. Allows for students across campuses to find and join groups who like playing similar games

## How to run

1. Make sure [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager) is installed on your device
2. Run `npm i`
3. After dependencies are installed, run `npm run dev`
